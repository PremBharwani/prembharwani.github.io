Hello there!ðŸ‘‹

I have completed my undergraduate degree at IIT Kanpur. My main interests revolve around Machine Learning, Computer Systems, and Software Development. During my time at IITK I've been actively involved & have led various initiatives at the [Science & Technology Council](https://sntiitk.com/) and the [Programming Club](https://pclub.in/). I thrive in a fast-paced environment that fuels my passion for learning and building exciting projects! I have worked with [ Oracle India ](https://www.oracle.com/in/), [ Kritsnam Technologies ](https://kritsnam.com/), and [ Counsello.ai ](https://counsello.ai/) in the past.

Currently I am building crazy stuff with a bunch of awesome folks at [FuzeðŸš€](https://fuze.finance)!
